            <p>
                The extension is now considered Freedom Games's (the company behind wiki.gg) first-party project.
                Because of the limitations of Microsoft Edge's Add-ons Portal, this required publishing the extension
                again under their developer account.
            </p>

                To keep up to date with future changes, updates, and wiki support, please <a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/redirect-to-wikigg/pagmnhcicfingbflafkgemhdaadpojoo">install the new, first-party version found here</a>.
                Afterwards uninstall this version.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Redirect to wiki.gg" will continue to work, but will not receive any future code or wiki support
                updates.

                This message is being shown to you, because you're a user of Microsoft Edge and have installed
                <i>Redirect to wiki.gg</i> from the Edge Add-ons Portal before the publisher has been changed.
