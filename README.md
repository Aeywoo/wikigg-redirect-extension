Extensions to redirect from abandoned Fandom wikis to wiki.gg wikis:
* The `ARK` folder contains a version with ARK: Survival Evolved branding, only supporting that one wiki.
* The `Generic` folder contains a version with no game-specific branding or restrictions.

Version numbers are kept in sync.
